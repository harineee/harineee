### Hello, I'm Harini ðŸ˜º

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering at RV College of Engineering, Bengaluru, while also working toward a Diploma in Data Science and Programming from IIT Madras. My interests lie at the intersection of hardware and intelligence, particularly in RTL design, embedded systems, data-driven debugging, and quantum computing.

Technically, I enjoy working with:
- Verilog, SystemVerilog, and simulation tools for digital design
- Python and TCL scripting for automation and test pattern generation
- Embedded C, STM32, Arduino, and microcontroller-level programming
- Applied machine learning, especially in embedded and edge contexts
- Web development with HTML, CSS, JS, Flask, and data-driven dashboards

When I'm not building or debugging, I enjoy spending time with my cat Miso, doing art, reading, running, and tuning into the latest Grand Prix.
